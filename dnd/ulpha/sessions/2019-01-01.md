The session opens with Ada addressing the fallen Merry in the guise of her late friend Nikki.

Ada lies to Merry, saying her friend Nikki forgives her for killing him, and asks what Merry has been up to since Nikki was killed.

Merry explains that the goblins stole the blasting equipment from the Orchid, and used it to free an ancient Elven fiend named Orpheal. She says they are basing out of the goblin warrens.

She also says the goblins did something to her, presumeably whatever it was that made her look deathly, and gave her magical abilities.

Merry says the goblins will kill her if she returns.

Ada finished talking with Merry, and haphazardly withdrew from the conversation, attempting to maintain her illusion.

A dwarf then called out from a nearby house, and after some conversation, invited the party in. Roland secured Merry in a locked room in the house.

Inside the house were a score of able-bodied villagers and their pets and valued belongings. The dwarf, Devin Fletcher (an old dwarven name), the brother of Tavon Fletcher, was mayor of the village. He explained the goblins attacked, and captured a dozen villagers. He gave the party a list of villagers to rescue. The villagers also rewarded the party for rescuing them.
