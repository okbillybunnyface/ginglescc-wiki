The session opens with Ada addressing the fallen Merry in the guise of her late friend Nikki.

Ada lies to Merry, saying her friend Nikki forgives her for killing him, and asks what Merry has been up to since Nikki was killed.

Merry explains that the goblins stole the blasting equipment from the Orchid, and used it to free an ancient Elven fiend named Orpheal. She says they are basing out of the goblin warrens.
