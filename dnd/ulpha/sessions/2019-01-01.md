<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2019-01-01 Earth, 3789-??-?? Ulpha -->

The session opens with Ada addressing the fallen Merry in the guise of her late friend Nikki.

Ada lies to Merry, saying her friend Nikki forgives her for killing him, and asks what Merry has been up to since Nikki was killed.

Merry explains that the goblins stole the blasting equipment from the Orchid, and used it to free an ancient Elven fiend named Orpheal. She says they are basing out of the goblin warrens.

She also says the goblins did something to her, presumeably whatever it was that made her look deathly, and gave her magical abilities.

Merry says the goblins will kill her if she returns.

Ada finished talking with Merry, and haphazardly withdrew from the conversation, attempting to maintain her illusion.

A dwarf then called out from a nearby house, and after some conversation, invited the party in. Roland secured Merry in a locked room in the house.

Inside the house were a score of able-bodied villagers and their pets and valued belongings. The dwarf, Devin Fletcher (an old dwarven name), the brother of Tavon Fletcher, was mayor of the village. He explained the goblins attacked, and captured a dozen villagers. He gave the party a list of villagers to rescue. The villagers also rewarded the party for rescuing them.

After the rewards, the party interrogated Merry. Merry indicated that she drank the blood supplied by Orpheal, and has been different ever since. She also told us that the goblin warren is heavily defended, but the goblins broke into the side of Orpheal's chamber, which means the front door is not connected to their warren, and we'd be able to get in relatively easily.

Folen then exorcised the vampire out of Merry, and she ate a fried egg sandwich. Dhalia freed her.

After casting sending a couple of times, Folen realized he knew exactly where the tomb is, and the party sought out toward it.

It was high up the mountain, and was very tiring to climb, but the party made it with ease.

Folen immediately saw the trail to the elven ruins, but the everyone else had extreme difficulty finding it, even when Folen pointed it out to them. After a short struggle, the entire party found the correct path, and they arrived at the front door to a tunnel.

Folen guessed that he needed to give it blood, and it glowed and opened.

The party entered, and came upon a pit. Roland and Ada made a rope swing to get across, and Ada swang across first. She fell through an illusory floor into a pit and was immediately attacked by snakes. She dispatched the snakes and herself, and the party rescued her afterwards.

After that the party made it over the pit with no difficulty, and came upon a metal door. Dalton kicked it open, and 5 armored elven golems with polearms attacked the party.

The party defeated the elven golems, and found themselves in a corridor dusted with rust and capped at the end with another iron door.

This iron door had a lock with a crystal mounted right above it.

Dhalia deftly disabled the trap and picked the lock. The door opened to a hallway with a spiral stair descending counter-clockwise. The party proceeded down the stair, and Stadwin was struck in his side by an arrow trap. Dhalia moved to the front of the party and began screening for traps. 

After finding 3 more traps, the party reached the bottom of the stair. There, the hallway narrowed, and there were many carvings of grotesque creatures along the ceiling.

When the party passed under the carvings, two came to life and attacked the party. The party killed the gargoyles quickly, and proceeded once again. They rounded a corner, and found another locked door.

Dhalia began picking the lock, but made noise. Just as she successfully unlocked the door, a hand ephemerally reached through the door and grabbed Dhalia, dealing a bunch of necrotic damage to her.

The party then sprang through the door, won a tough fight with two ghosts and then investigated two mummified elven bodies near a trap door. The bodies presumably belonged to the ghosts. The party looted the mummified corpses and then steeled themselves for what lay under the trap door.
