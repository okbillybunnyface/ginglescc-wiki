We arrive at the lighthouse. The lighthouse is just over 100 feet tall. The party approaches the lighthouse's 20-foot-wide entrance door, and Ada and Stadwin hear muffled voices behind it. Unfortunately, Roland loudly knocks on the door immediately as we reach it.

Roland's knock alerts many eel-like humanoids to the party's presence. They ambush the party on the first floor of the lighthouse, and the party is able to kill 9 of them, and 1 escapes down a trapdoor that leads to a cove underneath the lighthouse.

After the fight, the party discovers the aforementioned trapdoor that leads down into a cove. They also discover a bedroom on the first floor that has an empty weapon rack in it.

Afterward, the party blocked the trapdoor leading down, and ventured up the spiral staircase. At the top of the spiral stair, there was an iron door. Behind the door, was a frightened, sickened human named Lucian Skyehorne who had been there, barricaded from the eel people for 2 days. The party discussed the eel people, and his backstory. His family has a sacred bowl in the cove that has been magically active recently. The party agreed to escort him to the cove.
