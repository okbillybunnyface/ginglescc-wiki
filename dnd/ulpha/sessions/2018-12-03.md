<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2018-12-03 Earth, 3789-??-?? Ulpha -->

The session opens with the party observing many refugees entering the town. Nearly all the refugees are elderly or very young; few adults are with them.

Sergeant Fowler seems displeased. She asks Dalton questions about the party's objectives, and Dalton discloses nearly everything even though he did not have to. She expresses concern 

The girl who reported the goblins to the party claimed her village is to the southwest, and the party set forth on horseback with the intent to arrive in the village around nightfall.

After the party had been travelling about 90 minutes, Roland's horse tripped over a tripwire, and Roland received 2 crossbow bolts from afar. It was a group of Oronodran soldiers, obscured by brush on either side of the path, which was in a depression. The party quickly defeated the soldiers, and questioned the leader, who Roland happened to recognize. After explaining they were not there to attack Oronodre, the Oronordran leader seemed to become less hostile, and reported his group was the furthest to the south. The party continued southwest toward the village.

They arrive at the village after nightfall. Dhalia can hear chanting coming from the village, and light from fires is visible in the town. The windows and doors in the town appear to have been boarded over, and the boards bear many claw marks. Some of the boards are missing.

The party approaches with Stadwin and Roland in front, not attempting to hide. The remainder of the party attempt to approach stealthily. Battle breaks out, and the party begins to fight with  a group of goblins. During the fight, a goblin vampire as well as a halfling mage attack the party.

The party vanquishes the group, and a few goblins escape. The halfling mage is knocked unconscious and captured by the party, and Ada recognizes the halfling mage as the one she attacked in the mountain pass. Additionally, since a yak was killed in the fight, the party agrees to eat yak burgers later.

Just as the fight ends, Ada casts Alter Self on herself and takes the form of a tall, slim human male with dark hair that has been bloodied, and appears slightly gaunt and pale. Ada then claims she has an idea, and does her best to usher the rest of the group out of eyesight of the halfling before the halfling wakes, asking the party intervene if the halfing attacks her.

Ada moves close to the halfling, and when the halfling wakes, Ada says "Hello Merry."
