<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2018-12-03 Earth, 3789-??-?? Ulpha -->

The session opens with the party observing many refugees entering the town. Nearly all the refugees are elderly or very young; few adults are with them.

Sergeant Fowler seems displeased. She asks Dalton questions about the party's objectives, and Dalton discloses nearly everything even though he did not have to.

The girl who reported the goblins to the party claimed her village is to the southwest, and the party set forth on horseback with the intent to arrive in the village around nightfall.

After the party had been travelling about 90 minutes, Roland's horse tripped over a tripwire, and Roland received 2 crossbow bolts from afar.
