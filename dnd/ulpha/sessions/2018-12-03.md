<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2018-12-03 Earth, 3789-??-?? Ulpha -->

The session opens with the party observing many refugees entering the town. Nearly all the refugees are elderly or very young; few adults are with them.

Sergeant Fowler seems displeased. She asks Dalton questions about the party's objectives, and Dalton discloses nearly everything even though he did not have to. She expresses concern 

The girl who reported the goblins to the party claimed her village is to the southwest, and the party set forth on horseback with the intent to arrive in the village around nightfall.

After the party had been travelling about 90 minutes, Roland's horse tripped over a tripwire, and Roland received 2 crossbow bolts from afar. It was a group of Oronodran soldiers, obscured by brush on either side of the path, which was in a depression. The party quickly defeated the soldiers, and questioned the leader, who Roland happened to recognize. After explaining they were not there to attack Oronodre, the Oronordran leader seemed to become less hostile, and reported his group was the furthest to the south. The party continued southwest toward the village.
