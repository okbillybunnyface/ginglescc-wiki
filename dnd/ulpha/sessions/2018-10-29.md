<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2018-10-29 Earth, 3789-08-19 Ulpha -->

It's 5 full days after the beginning of the last session.

We woke at the Salmon Belly and immediately walked to meet Bruna.

Once we arrived, both Bruna and Sohonae were present for the meeting.

Bruna explained that the Orchid claimed we had accepted a job with advanced pay, and ran off with the money, and that we had been killed.

We explained everything that happened thusfar in the mountains.

She asks us to stay on as town guards, and in the meantime we can interview the druid.

Tony two bags tells Ada about a woman named "Wander" in Satla. He does not know much about her, but she "has her hands in a lot of pies". She is an information broker among the criminal element. He also gives Ada the location of a bar in a district of Satla called Freemount, where criminals sometime do business.

Bruna road into town and inquired with Kosie on how to obtain the coin, and then began campaigning to get on the town council.

Hap Longshanks hired us to investigate a ship that was lost off of Skyhorne Lighthouse. It was attacked by a "sea monster".

There is a crew member, a young boy he wants us to return. He suggested we seek out Sheila Coppertree, Sohone's sister.

We find Sheila Coppertree at the Salty Gull, a tavern on the docks. They sell salty eggs that are too salty, but Ada likes them. They also have gross pickles.

The docks are abnormally crowded with ships.

Sheila begins to take us to her vessel, the Annabell Lee. She is also interested in finding the Jade Lion, since she is friends with the captain.														

On the way to the ship on the docks, there is a very cologne-ridden orc with filed-down tusks. There is also a human who seems disgruntled. They attack, and we dispatch them with minor injuries. We continue onto the Annabelle Lee.

We set out toward the Lighthouse immediately. It can be seen shining from the Uldahn dock, and it only takes us about an hour to arrive at it.

Once we near the lighthouse, we are attacked by a
