<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2018-11-26 Earth, 3789-08-?? Ulpha -->

The session begins with the party leaving the town, having been kicked out for causing a disturbance.

They proceed out of town toward an inn that is at a crossroads a few hours north of Ascent. It is quite cold and snowing, and the sun sets along the journey. Unfortunately, along the way, Dalton guides the party off the trail, and they accidentally travel several hours to the east.

While off the path, the party is attacked by were-tigers. Ada and Folen were immediately incapacitated. Folen nearly died, but was briefly revived before he was again struck unconscious. The party scraped by with only a fraction of them staying conscious. One of the weretigers escaped into the night. The party was able to claim one weretiger skin from the bodies, but the second reverted to normal humanoid tiger form before the party was able to get it.

After the fight, the party licked their wounds and attempted to return to the trail.

They eventually arrived at the inn on the crossroads, and stayed the knight.

In the morning, they ate breakfast and conversed with a halfling at the tavern. The halfling indicated some racist animosity toward Corrialan humans, and as a result the party learned there is an active, secretive conflict between Oronodran and Corrialan forces.

Stadwin concludes the Corrialan forces are not acting under the instructions of the Corrialan crown, and suggests the party make efforts to neutralize the conflict.
