<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2018-11-26 Earth, 3789-08-?? Ulpha -->

The session begins with the party leaving the town, having been kicked out for causing a disturbance.

They proceed out of town toward an inn that is at a crossroads a few hours north of Ascent. It is quite cold and snowing, and the sun sets along the journey. Unfortunately, along the way, Dalton guides the party off the trail, and they accidentally travel several hours to the east.

While off the path, the party is attacked by were-tigers. Ada and Folen were immediately incapacitated. Folen nearly died, but was briefly revived before he was again struck unconscious. The party scraped by with only a fraction of them staying conscious. One of the weretigers escaped into the night. The party was able to claim one weretiger skin from the bodies, but the second reverted to normal humanoid tiger form before the party was able to get it.

After the fight, the party licked their wounds and attempted to return to the trail.

They eventually arrived at the inn on the crossroads, and stayed the knight.

In the morning, they ate breakfast and conversed with a halfling at the tavern. The halfling indicated some racist animosity toward Corrialan humans, and as a result the party learned there is an active, secretive conflict between Oronodran and Corrialan forces.

Stadwin concludes the Corrialan forces are not acting under the instructions of the Corrialan crown, and suggests the party make efforts to neutralize the conflict.

The party leaves the inn, and sets forth toward Ettinsburg, a town in a disputed area between Oronordre, Corrialys, and West Ryehold. About halfway to Ettinsburg, the party hears a scream off in the woods. After investigating, they find a human woman in Oronodran regalia bleeding out. They heal her, and transport her with them to Ettinsburg.

Once arriving in Ettinsburg, they discover a very diverse town. There are people about from all walks of life, and they all seem to be wary of Stadwin, the Corrialan.

Stadwin questions some Corrialan soldiers in the town, and they summon Emma Fowler, a Corrialan officer in charge of them. She is accompanied by Byron Bearclaw.

Dalton subtley moves the Oronordran soldier to another group of Oronordan soldiers, and learns her name is Tiki.

Stadwin goes off the Corrialan soldiers to converse with them. Dhalia and Ada pursue them attempting to be stealthy, and follow them to a straight up d&d tavern, manned by a bald human man with white hair sticking up and missing a couple teeth.

Stadwin converses with officer Fowler, and determines that she does not really know what the Corrialan's orders are, and only knows they are there to "bleed into the forest". She asks Stadwin to request that the crown recall their forces from the forest.
