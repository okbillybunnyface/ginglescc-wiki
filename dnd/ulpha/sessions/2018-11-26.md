<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2018-11-26 Earth, 3789-08-?? Ulpha -->

The session begins with the party leaving the town, having been kicked out for causing a disturbance.

They proceed out of town toward an inn that is at a crossroads a few hours north of Ascent. It is quite cold and snowing, and the sun sets along the journey. Unfortunately, along the way, Dalton guides the party off the trail, and they accidentally travel several hours to the east.

While off the path, the party is attacked by were-tigers. Ada and Folen were immediately incapacitated. Folen nearly died, but was briefly revived before he was again struck unconscious.
