<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2018-11-06 Earth, 3789-08-?? Ulpha -->

The session begins with Lucian giving the party three potions of water breathing.

Once the potion situation is sorted, the party descends to the trapdoor, and then descends down into the cove below the lighthouse, with Stadwin in the lead.

At the bottom of the ladder, is a 5 foot square of ground to stand on, and the room is very dark.

The party uses light spells to illuminate the cavern to the best of their ability. Eyes are seen in the water surrounding the ladder. The party leaps into the water, and determines the eyes to be sharks. Dhalia tosses meat into distant water and the sharks chase it, and the party is able to reach a sand bank a short distance from the ladder.

There is a stone wall with a door on the sandbank.

The party notices the Jade Lion in a state of disrepair some distance into the cove, to the right of the sandbank from the perspective of the trapdoor.

Most of the party jumps back into the water to investigate the Jade Lion, but Dhalia and Stadwin remain on the sandbank and investigate the door on the stone wall.
