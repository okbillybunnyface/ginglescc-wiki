<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2018-11-16 Earth, 3789-08-?? Ulpha -->

The session begins with Lucian giving the party three potions of water breathing.

Once the potion situation is sorted, the party descends to the trapdoor, and then descends down into the cove below the lighthouse, with Stadwin in the lead.

At the bottom of the ladder, is a 5 foot square of ground to stand on, and the room is very dark.

The party uses light spells to illuminate the cavern to the best of their ability. Eyes are seen in the water surrounding the ladder. The party leaps into the water, and determines the eyes to be sharks. Dhalia tosses meat into distant water and the sharks chase it, and the party is able to reach a sand bank a short distance from the ladder.

There is a stone wall with a door on the sandbank.

The party notices the Jade Lion in a state of disrepair some distance into the cove, to the right of the sandbank from the perspective of the trapdoor.

Most of the party jumps back into the water to investigate the Jade Lion, but Dhalia and Stadwin remain on the sandbank and investigate the door on the stone wall.

The party-members that swam to the boat noticed Lucian "talk" to the sharks, and the sharks swam off into the distant water. The party approached the boat without incident. On the boat the party found Hap Longshanks son, Raf Longshanks. He was distrustful of the party and decided to remain on the Jade Lion until the party cleared out the Eel folk.

Dhalia and Stadwin sneakily open the door along the stone wall, and notice two eel folk playing a more brutal variation of jacks where they stick the jacks in their fins.

The party members that investigated the ship return to the sandbank, and the party initiates combat with the eels, taking the eels by surprise.

Dalton uses a bead of force, and two more eels are revealed, who the party quickly dispatch.

In addition to the eels, there are several crew from the Jade Lion tied up in the room, one of which is the Jade Lion's captain, who prefers to be called Aaron.

Once the fight is over, the party frees the captives, and the captain informs us the eels took a crew member hostage. The hostage is Lucian's nephew.

The group explores the adjacent rooms. One room is nothing but cargo from the Jade Lion, as well as a passage that leads back to the water. The other door leads to a larger room with a strange humming sound. Lucian indicates that the sound is coming from his family's ritual being performed.

In the larger room, a fight breaks out. The party defeats a few eels, and a loud humming noise reverberated throughout the room.

The party continues to fight with the eel folk. One of the eel folk is covered in shower-curtain-sized piercings, and appears to be leading the ritual. It is able to cast relatively powerful spells.
