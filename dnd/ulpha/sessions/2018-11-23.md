<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2018-11-23 Earth, 3789-08-26 Ulpha -->

The session begins in the midst of combat with the water elemental.

The group collectively goes on a trip into infinity, and experiences another time, place, and perspective.

They return either an instant or an eternity later, with valuable new experiences and talents.

Using their newly acquired skills, the party quickly defeats the water elemental, and finds a number of magic items.

They investigate the bowl the eels were using in the ritual, and determine it is not one of the special magic items. It is merely an ancient magic item.

After the fight, the party talks with Lucian Skyhorne and his nephew. Roland determined that Lucian's family ritual begin acting up at the same time the Bell of Calling fell in the water, which was the day of the first of Redfall.

Meanwhile, the Jade Lion's crew and Dalton load cargo onto the Jade Lion.

The party leaves on the Jade Lion after the crew and Dhalia repair the ship.

The party arrives back in Ulpha shortly after dusk. The party takes wagons back to their headquarters. Stadwin is not amused that the butler is sleeping in his room at the Sword and Sundry, and seeks a room in town.

Stadwin goes to a meeting with Bruna, and Dhalia does as well, though they meet separately.

Ada studies with Khose, while Dalton trains Difo and makes poison bolts/arrows with the help of Folen.

Stadwin teaches a class on spellcasting at MHNA.
