<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2018-10-08 Earth, 3789-08-?? Ulpha -->

It's 12 days after the final full moon of summer.

(Beginning of session)

We began in a vertical staircase, having just defeated a large fungus dragon after descending a long way.

It seemed like several thousand feet of altitude that we had descended before we reached the bottom.

The bottom of the staircase was a large, open cavern full of phosphorescent mushrooms, and small bits of light peeking through the ceiling. In it was the Myconid city. It is a very colorful city, built upon what seems like the ruins of a preexisting dwarven city.

In the city were many livestock. Some of them were even elk, just as Imogen has said. Many of the livestock sport mushrooms from the tops of their head.

Some humans were also in the settlement, but they seem somewhat zombified, and uncanny. Their eyes appeared as circular stains of mold, and their torsos appeared as if they were wearing very baggy clothing, all brightly colored.

As we approached them, they also approached us. Many were carrying weapons, but didn't seem especially hostile.

Imogen begins to walk in front of the party, leading us into the group of "people" toward a large mushroomy, mossy stepped pyramid.

Imogen claims the myconid people do not talk, and we will need to breath in spores in order to communicate, and attempt not to vomit as they fine that something adjacent to offensive. She says it is unlikely we will be able to make it through the city without inhaling the spores. We will need to talk to "the Sovereign" in order to get permission to pass.

Once we reached the Sovereign, Imogen breathes in the spores and lays down with her eyes closed. Ada, Dalton, and Folen follow and also breath in the spores. Stadwin, Roland, and Dhalia refuse to partake.

The four who partook laid on the floor and mumbled incoherently, each having their own vision. Dalton seemed amused. Ada seemed angry. Folen and Imogen seemed blissful.

Ada determined the myconid want three of our items. Imogen determined the myconid want us to go kill something by a lake.

Ada attempted to give the myconid her staff, which was one of the items they wanted, but the myconid were confused. Ada breathed in spores again, and determined they could choose either to kill the thing by the lake or give them items.

The party elected to go to the lake before Ada woke, and Ada managed to communicate to Roland that he should grab her staff before they left.

Roland carried Ada to the lake. There was a cave under the lake, and sheep legs around the edge of the lake. We gathered we were supposed to kill something in the cave.

Dhalia threw a sheep leg into the cave, and nothing happened even after 20 minutes.

Imogen and Folen jumped into the water, and swam down to the cave.

Shortly after entering the cave, the party was attacked by a black dragon about 30 feet long. There was also a swarm of bugs as well as an area of darkness, each of which moving around to follow the party.

The battle did not go well, and Imogen was killed, though the rest of the party escaped.

After the battle, Tall Jan was extremely upset after learning Imogen was killed. The myconic were also displeased.

Ada, due to her fondness of dragons, greatly upset the myconid, and the party was ejected from the Myconid city on the south side.
