It's 12 days after the final full moon of summer.

We began in a vertical staircase, having just defeated a large fungus dragon after descending a long way.

It seemed like several thousand feet of altitude that we had descended before we reached the bottom.

The bottom of the staircase was a large, open cavern full of phosphorescent mushrooms, and small bits of light peeking through the ceiling. In it was the Myconid city. It is a very colorful city, built upon what seems like the ruins of a preexisting dwarven city.

In the city were many livestock. Some of them were even elk, just as Imogen has said. Many of the livestock sport mushrooms from the tops of their head.

Some humans were also in the settlement, but they seem somewhat zombified, and uncanny. Their eyes appeared as circular stains of mold, and their torsos appeared as if they were wearing very baggy clothing, all brightly colored.

As we approached them, they also approached us. Many were carrying weapons, but didn't seem especially hostile.

Imogen begins to walk in front of the party, leading us into the group of "people" toward a large mushroomy, mossy stepped pyramid.

Imogen claims the myconid people do not talk, and we will need to breath in spores in order to communicate, and attempt not to vomit as they fine that something adjacent to offensive. She says it is unlikely we will be able to make it through the city without inhaling the spores. We will need to talk to "the Sovereign" in order to get permission to pass.

Once we reached the Sovereign, Imogen breathes in the spores and lays down with her eyes closed. Ada, Dalton, and Folen follow and also breath in the spores. Stadwin, Roland, and Dhalia refuse to partake.
