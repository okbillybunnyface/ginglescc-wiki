We began in a vertical staircase, having just defeated a large fungus dragon after descending a long way.

It seemed like several thousand feet of altitude that we had descended before we reached the bottom.

The bottom of the staircase was a large, open cavern full of phosphorescent mushrooms, and small bits of light peeking through the ceiling. In it was a very colorful city, built upon what seemed like the ruins of a preexisting dwarven city.

In the city were many livestock. Some of them were even elk, just as Imogen has said. Many of the livestock sport mushrooms from the tops of their head.

Some humans were also in the settlement, but they seem somewhat zombified, and uncanny. Their eyes appeared as circular stains of mold, and their torsos appeared as if they were wearing very baggy clothing, all brightly colored.
