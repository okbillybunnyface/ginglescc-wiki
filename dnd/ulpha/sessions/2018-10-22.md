<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2018-10-22 Earth, 3789-08-?? Ulpha -->

It's 13 days after the final full moon of summer.

The session begins with the myconids unceremoniously leaving the party in a forest at the mouth of the cave. We are nearer to Satla than to Ulpha.

Folen finds a grove of trees for us to sleep in, and we make camp. Ada seems very out of it, chattering and muttering to herself, Dhalia has an infected wound from the battle. Stadwin seems distant.

Folen is able to successfully treat Dhalia's wound such that it will not worsen.

Folen takes first watch. Nothing happens.

At some point in the night, Stadwin's stuff is disturbed, after he heard a screech.

Dalton takes watch after last.

The party wakes early, and makes their way to Satla.

We eventually reach Satla. The "Jewel of the Nisquall Commonwealth". 

\<Satla description\>

It has a population of approximately 100,000 people, mostly humans and halflings. It is a coastal city, with many seagulls and salty air.

Dalton goes to a bookstore and inquires about exercise manuals. He buys some books, and goes to a place called the Bow House in order to read them.

Ada and Dhalia go to the library, and shuffle through books.

Stadwin goes to buy armor. The armorer is near the Bow House. The shopkeep's name is Ocha. She is an older elf with striking, paper-white hair. She is extremely snobby, and shuns Stadwin once she realizes he cannot afford the armor in the shop. Stadwin borrows money from Dalton, and returns to Ocha for sweet armor.

Roland also seeks out information via books, but separately from Ada and Dhalia.

Dhalia goes and conferrs with her employers.

Roland looks around for the knightliest knight, and once he finds him, talks to him for a while about knightly things. Amir Silverhair is his name. He offers Roland work.

Ada visits a magic curiosity shop on the west side of town called Pike's. She leaves disappointed.

Ada and Dhalia have an argument, with Ada accusing Dhalia of being a narc.

After spending 3 days in Satla, we take a carriage to Ulpha.

The carriage driver's name is "James Jameson".

We arrive at the witch's house in Ulpha on the morning of the 4th day of the session.

The party conveys the details of what occurred to the Kosi. She says the marks on the bell and the mirror are the "marks of calling".

There is another that is a hammer made by a God named Luqual, the forge god in the mountains.

The mirror is the mirror of Eredris, the goddess of death.

The bell is called the bell of Olish, the progenitor of the shamanic tradition.

The lore said the bell being separated from the gulch was key to prevent flooding.

We decided to question the druid prisoner who had attempted the ritual with the bell, since he should have had similar motivations to Imogen with the bell.

We shacked up in the Salmon's Belly.
