<!-- SUBTITLE: The session of 2018-10-22 Earth, 3789-08-?? Ulpha -->

It's 13 days after the final full moon of summer.

The session begins with the myconids unceremoniously leaving the party in a forest at the mouth of the cave. We are nearer to Satla than to Ulpha.

Folen finds a grove of trees for us to sleep in, and we make camp. Ada seems very out of it, chattering and muttering to herself, Dhalia has an infected wound from the battle. Stadwin seems distant.

Folen is able to successfully treat Dhalia's wound such that it will not worsen.

Folen takes first watch. Nothing happens.

At some point in the night, Stadwin's stuff is disturbed, after he heard a screech.

Dalton takes watch after last.

The party wakes early, and makes their way to Satla.

We eventually reach Satla. The "Jewel of the Nisquall Commonwealth". It has a population of approximately 100,000 people, mostly humans and halflings. It is a coastal city, with many seagulls and salty air.
