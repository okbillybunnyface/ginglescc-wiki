# Dwarven Reckoning
The common calendar of the Nisqwal is the Dwarven Reckoning, a mixed lunisolar calendar that puts the current year at 3789 and begins at a major event called the Battle of the Gate. Though few Humans or Elves know the history of this battle, the calendar has stuck as a fairly complete recounting of natural phenomena. 

A year begins on the first full moon following the Vernal Equinox and is either 12 Months (354 days) or 13 Months (383-385 days) long. These intervals repeat over a 32 year cycle. In general, the years alternate between long and short, though the long year is skipped four times per cycle, on the 7th, 15th, 23rd, and 31st year. Thus the sequence of year lengths is as follows:

385
354
383
354

 The year 3789 is a 385-day year, as the first day of the year fell directly on the Vernal Equinox. Months are always either 29 or 30 days, alternating beginning with 29, except that on a 32nd year (such as this one), the first month is 30 days, creating two straight 30-day months at the beginning of the year. The thirteenth month alternates between 29 and 30 days. This year it will be 30 days.

As a consequence of these fairly arcane practices, the first day of the month always has a full moon in the sky either the night before or the night after. 

The month names are:
Seafoam
Branchbud
Nectarbloom
Stormsquall
Ascendancy
Stillair
Redleaf
Northwind
Dormancy
Hearthfire
Sleetfall
Bitterbread
Longshadow (13th month)


A table can be found at the below address, which may help to understand the months of the year as they generally relate to the seasons. The relation to Earth months should be taken with a generous helping of salt, as these relations do not perfectly match up on any given part of the cycle.
