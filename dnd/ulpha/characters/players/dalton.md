<!-- SUBTITLE: Joe's character. -->

# Description
## Appearance
Dalton is probably 5’11” but he tells people he’s 6’. He’s a little on the skinny side and he’s got lean muscle rather than bulk. He’s sort of like a rock climber where he has a lot of muscles normal people tend to ignore. Very low body fat. He’s fair skinned with a little tan and es probably pretty good looking but not like strikingly so. He cleans up okay if we went to a party or something. He’s got a mop of messy sandy brown hair and he probably wears a headband most of the time. If you gave him a shave and a haircut and put him in fancy clothes he’d probably look like a nobleman.
