# Description

Dalton is as swift as a coursing river, but with all the force of a great typhoon. He has all the strength of a raging fire, and is mysterious as the dark side of the moon... well, not really, but that's the impression he'd like people to have.

## Appearance

Dalton is 5'10'' which is a little taller than the average person, but he says he's 6'0" to anyone who asks. Life in the monastery was a rigorous pursuit of physical perfection, so Dalton sports a fairly impressive physique despite a very lean build. He is fairly handsome, with a noble sort of bearing. That being said, he keeps his sandy blond hair in an unkempt mop and prefers simple clothing and robes that allow him free range of movement.
