# Description
## Appearance
Ada is a 4'6" elf of a typical build, so pretty waifish. She has green eyes and short cerulean hair. Her skin is alabaster, or alternately like a cold marble-white, except for patches of slightly pearlescent white-bronze scales that line the dorsal side (back of) her neck and arms. She presumably has scales on her back and legs as well, but that's obscured by her clothing. If she is wearing a sleeve (she typically is), they're only barely visible on her neck and wrists. She wears unassuming earthy clothing, usually human style.
