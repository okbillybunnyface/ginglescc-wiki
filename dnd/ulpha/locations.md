# The Nisqwal Commonwealth

The Nisqwal Commonwealth is a loose collection of cities, towns, and villages along the coast of the Irenic Ocean and bordered by the Skaj'it mountains to the north. The land is fertile, savage, and rainy. The Humans native to the area are typically copper-skinned, with brown, green, or grey eyes and hair ranging from red through brown to black. Halflings are common to the area as well, and often mingle with humans in the sames cities, though due to their architechtural preferences are often concentrated in boroughs within those cities. Dwarves, Elves, and Gnomes are rarer, though legends tell there was a time when they were widespread. Nonetheless, there is little tension between these humanoid races, as the culture of the area is strongly communalist and tolerant. Most administration is handled by an elected council, commonly consisting of three members. A large municipality may have several councils, each governing a specific aspect of policy, but commonly mingling and voting together on issues of interest to all.


## Ulpha

"The town of Ulpha is often called Mudharbor; the name was first used by the Mudharbor Trading Company, and became the unofficial moniker of the town for reasons that don't take long to see; the mornings are misty even now in the late summer, and those few days when the clouds do break in the afternoon are even less pleasant, growing unbearably humid, the air itself sweating.
[...]
"Ulpha is a town hacked from the forests at the Eastern tip of the Whulge, a many-fingered inlet that cuts deep inland. From here, goods of the Sqaj'it mountains and the plains north thereof find their way onto ships that run up and down the coast. It is a prosperous city, though it doesn't look it; the buildings, though well-crafted, are universally flecked in mud and black mold, and all but the most well-maintained succumb to the creep of vines on at least part of their structure. If every axe left Ulpha, the saying goes, it would be jungle in two years"

## Satla

To the degree that the Nisqwal Commonwealth has a "capital", it would be Satla. A bustling hub of trade activity, this city is visible from some miles due to the Skyspire, a gleaming tower of glass and steel which the wealthy Sisma family constructed some forty years ago as a symbol of their desire to unite the commonwealth. The Sisma's rise to prominence in the last half-century has been aided by the late patriarch Indolen's discovery of a set of precognitive triplets, who have allowed Satlan agents to interdict a number of supernatural threats to villages throughout the commonwealth. The family's current leader is a woman named Qal Sisma, Indolen's eldest daughter. Satla is Dahlia's home, and she works for the city guard, though a handler named Diane has recruited her into the service of these oracles and sent her to Ulpha to investigate one of their visions.

## Old Nisqwal

The oldest town in Nisqwal, this town sits on a muddy river delta and surrounds the hollow husk of a broken tree two hundred feet across at its base. The town is a shell of its former self, as some eighty years ago it was host to an apocalyptic cult of druids called the Oasha, who used the tree as a locus of power to call forth an ancient spirit. Though the ritual was stopped, the tree was shattered and many residents were killed. The disaster at Old Nisqwal has been an impetus for many small towns to call for a greater military readiness and concentration of power within the region, an anxiety that some less-than-wholesome organizations have chosen to exploit.
