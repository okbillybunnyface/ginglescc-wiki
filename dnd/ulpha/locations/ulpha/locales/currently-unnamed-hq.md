# Currently Unnamed HQ, Ulpha
As payment from the city of Ulpha for investigating magical disturbances in the valley, the party was given the deed to an old, dilapidated house on the outskirts of town. The grounds are overgrown, the masonry is in disrepair, much of the wood needs replacing and it's infested with back mold. 

Due to serious metal fatigue in all the load-bearing members, the wiring being substandard, it being completely inadequate for the pary's power needs, and the neighborhood being like a demilitarized zone, some feel that this building should be condemned. The party is confident, however that this house will make a worthy HQ someday.
